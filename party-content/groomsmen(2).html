<h4>Casey Brown</h4>

<p class="party-text">Casey is my little brother, the one I try new wrestling moves on, and sucker punch as he walks through the door.  We may be very different in many ways, and he may even be more mature than me, even though I am nine years older. However there is one thing that we do have one heck of a bond over, and that is our love for sports. I may not know my brothers favorite food, or his favorite movie, or what he is studying in school, but I know one thingâ€¦ the day of the Indians and Cubs World Series game, for the first time, when a two run home run was hit, bringing the score to a tie, for the first time in my life, my brother and I hugged in a way that only brothers could. There is a bond that we share that I am so thankful for, and I am so proud of my little brother in the way that he has grown into a true man, and I look forward to what his future brings him.</p>
