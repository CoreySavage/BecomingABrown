<h4>Kristina Gilliam</h4>

<p class="party-text">Not only is Kristina my big Sister, she is also my Best Friend. My entire life I have looked up to my Sister and followed in her footsteps. She is my role model, and an incredibly strong girl.  There is absolutely nobody in the world I would rather have as my Matron of Honor than her. I love her with my whole heart, and am honored to have her by my side on my wedding day, because I honestly couldnâ€™t do life without her.</p>
