<h4>Stephan Gilliam</h4>

<p class="party-text">Stephen is my Brother In Law, and the true brother I never got to have.  A few years ago he married my sister, and when I went to make my Maid of Honor speech for the big day, I kept taunting him that I would embarrass him, and make jokes about him because he likes to pick on me just like a big brother would.  However, what he did not know,  was that honestly, I had nothing bad to say, even in a joking manner.  I have watched him go from a trouble making teen, to a man that would do anything for my sister, and my Nephew and Niece, as well as myself, and that is the most important thing.
