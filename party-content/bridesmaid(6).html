<h4>Megan Crum</h4>

<p class="party-text">Megan is Dan’s Sister, and when our families blend, she will not only become my new sister, but also my friend. I am grateful to gain a sister like her, because she truly knows the importance of family, and will always be there for us. When Dan and I were first together, Megan actually said the words to me, “I am not supposed to like you, but you're making this very hard not to”, and I knew right then, I had won her approval in dating her brother. We have seen her raise two amazing kids, and cannot wait for the day we can raise our future kids with hers.  There was no doubt in my mind that I wanted to have her stand by our side as we get married, someone that has watched out for Dan his entire life, and now for us together, as we start on this new journey, as our families become one. </p>
