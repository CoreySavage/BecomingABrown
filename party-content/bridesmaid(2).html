<h4>Nicole Luke</h4>

<p class="party-text">The many nicknames I could go into right now...Sutter, One of the Pink Ladies, Curley, the one in the middle… Nicci and I are cousins and grew up very very close.  Three of us girls were born six weeks apart, and were inseparable at family events. We spent many days of our childhood eating chicklets at safety town, dancing to spice girls and random songs that were not even in english. I am thankful I have such an incredible cousin in my life. 
P.s… Hard Noodles…*Cough Cough*</p>
