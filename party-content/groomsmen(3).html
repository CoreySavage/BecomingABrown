<h4>Kenny Crum</h4>

<p class="party-text">
Kenny and I are brothers in law. We talk a lot about sports and he is a very goofy and funny person.  He's the guy that walks in the door on a holiday dressed as many different characters...The Easter Bunny, Ralphie from a christmas story, an Elf, and many more. He does anything to make his kids smile, and watching my niece and nephew have him as their Dad is truly a gift. He is a guy that I know would never judge me for the child I am at heart, because he too, shares that trait with me, and it makes us who we are.</p>
