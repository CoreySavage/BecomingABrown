<h4>Corey Savage</h4>

<p class="party-text">Corey is one of my many cousins, one that holds a special place in my heart.  Growing up, we spent every day in the Summer together at our grandma’s house.  Corey would play house with us and be the Dad...or the Mom, whichever we needed at the time.  We used our imaginations and played things like mermaids, and witches, he didn’t care, he was around all his girl cousins, and no boys, so the fact that he participated and put up with us at all was amazing.  Growing older, Corey brightens up a room when he walks in, and his personality is one that could make anyone smile. He is full of love, and compassion, and is a joy to be around.  There was no question in my mind, that I would have Corey in my wedding someday, but he has a big job to fill… Not only do I need Corey standing by my side as himself at our wedding,  but I need him to fill two peoples shoes….Corey will be representing not only himself, but also my older cousin, his older Brother, who passed..who I would give anything to stand at our wedding as well. Corey has a heart of gold, and I know for certain, that Johnny will be right at Corey’s side supporting him, and giving him strength on my wedding day.</p>
