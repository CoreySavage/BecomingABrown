<h4>Justin Granlund</h4>

<p class="party-text">Justin is one of my best friends still to this day, and it all started in Middle School. We shared a love for talking about super heroes, anime, and video games, and spent many hours walking around malls and toilet papering houses. A few years ago I had the honor of helping Justin propose to his current wife, and stand by his side as he married her.  I knew when I was ready to ask Tracey to marry me, there was no one else I'd rather ask for their help.  With a complete change of times last minute, Justin and his Wife showed up for me the exact moment I proposed to Tracey to take pictures and videotape the whole event. I am honored to have Justin take part in my special day and stand up there with me now, but more importantly, I am honored to have him as one of my best friends still to this day.</p>
