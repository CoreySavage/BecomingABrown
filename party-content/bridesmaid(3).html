<h4>Lauren Onda</h4>

<p class="party-text">Oh Norlan, where do I start….Lauren is the first born of the three of us girls that are six weeks apart.  She is the Larry to our curly and Moe, and one of the pink ladies, however, most importantly, Lauren has a heart of gold, and is the sweetest and most caring girl.  I feel blessed to have such an amazing cousin like her in my life.
P.s… Thanks for trialing my wedding with me so young.</p>
