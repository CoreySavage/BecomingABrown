<h4>Julia Savage</h4>

<p class="party-text">One of my not so little anymore cousins, Julia, who has become a beautiful, smart girl. She has faced some big obstacles in her life, and has overcome every one of them, showing me just how strong a girl can really be.. From us playing house at our Gram’s house every day in the summer growing up, and making brownies that tasted like cardboard, to sitting on the porch bench singing “Listen to your Heart”, still to this day, when that song comes on, I think of her, and even though we cannot see each other as much as I would like, Julia was always my buddy growing up, and I am amazed at the things she is accomplishing today in her life, I am so proud of her, and so happy that she will be standing by my side at my wedding.</p>
