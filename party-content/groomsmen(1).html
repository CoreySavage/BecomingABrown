<h4>Tom Brice</h4>

<p class="party-text">I met Tom doing comedy about 5 years ago, and since then he has become my very best friend.  People are amazed that we are even friends at all because of how opposite we really are, but somehow it just works. I have watched Tom turn his life around, and I have been beyond proud of the person he has become. No matter what life brings, I will always be there for him, and I know he will be for me as well. I knew from before Tracey and I were even engaged that he would be my Best Man at my wedding someday, and now I couldnâ€™t be more grateful that that day is coming near, and he will be standing by my side, as I marry the girl that he will say, made me the man I am today.
