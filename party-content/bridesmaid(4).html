<h4>Kayla Campola</h4>

<p class="party-text">In the last year and a half, Kayla began working with me at 
The Cleveland Clinic Children’s Hospital, and ever since then, 
she has no longer felt like my little cousin…
she feels more like a little sister to me, 
one I never had, but always wanted.
I will always watch out for her, 
and offer the best advice I can when life gets hard.  
She has an amazing talent for baking and cooking,
and I am convinced, one day, we will open our own bakery together. 
Until then, I am honored to have Kayla by my side as I walk down the aisle.
