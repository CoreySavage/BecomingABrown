<h4>Kerri Preztak</h4>

<p class="party-text">Kerri is one of my older cousins, one who spent everyday in the summer growing up,  taking my sister and I to the pool for the entire day, babysitting us all day long.  She looked out for me, and even helped me get a job for a while working at Party Place when I was in high school, and helped Dan in the process of getting his current job at Progressive.  Even in the last two years alone, I have watched Kerri have so much motivation to pursue the life that she wants, and she worked so hard to get to where she is now, and deserves the very best.  If it wasn't for kerri, I may not have a lot of what I do today, even though she may not realize how much she has truly helped in my life, I am so grateful for her, and blessed to have her there supporting Dan and I as we walk down the aisle. 
P.s.. I apologize in advance, I know youâ€™re going to kill me for this pic.
